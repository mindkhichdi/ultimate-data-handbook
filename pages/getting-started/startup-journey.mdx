# Startup Data Journey

Hello reader, start here if you'd like to understand the very basics of what a data team does and how it fits into an organisation.

For an explanation of some of the core technologies and concepts that data teams use, check out the [Core Concepts](/core-concepts) section.

Now, let's walk through an example of a small startup with a simple product.

Meet our startup - Our startup is a website called "Jaffle Shop" that sells jaffles online.

## MVP

### State of the Business

**Number of Employees**: 0

At the first level, the startup has a simple web application that is hosted on a single server.
The web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and place an order for a jaffle.

At this stage, you're not worried about scaling. You're just trying to get a product out the door.
You haven't raised any money yet and you're probably still trying to build this product in your spare time.

### Data - Not Yet

You have a very small amount of traffic and you can simply log into your SQL database to check if anyone has signed up or purchased anything.
At this early stage, you probably even remember the names of your users and can reach out to them directly if you need to.

## Pre-Seed

### State of the Business

**Number of Employees**: 1

You've been trying to get the word out about your product by posting on social media, running ads, and reaching out to bloggers and influencers.
As Jaffle Shop grows, you start to see more traffic. You're starting to get more users signing up and purchasing jaffles.

You've also added some more functionality to your web application. Users can now add jaffles to their cart and purchase them using a credit card.
You've also introduces two new kinds of jaffles in addition to "The Classic": "The Veggie" and "The Meat Lover".

### Basic Growth Metrics

You wonder how many users are signing up and purchasing jaffles each day. You also want to know which jaffles are the most popular and which users are the most valuable.
However your sales are still small enough for you to be able to manually track this information in a spreadsheet that you update every weekend.

You also install Google Analytics to track how many users are visiting your site and where they are coming from.

## Seed

### State of the Business

**Number of Employees**: 5 - 10

Your Jaffle Shop is the talk of the town. You've been featured by a few food bloggers and influencers and your sales are growing rapidly.
You now have a constant stream of new users signing up on the website, in addition to your existing users who keep coming back for more jaffles.

You've added a new feature that allows users to leave reviews for the jaffles they've purchased.
You've also added even more jaffles to your menu, including "The Breakfast Jaffle" and "The Dessert Jaffle" bringing the total number of jaffles to 5.

Your website is starting to slow down and you're starting to see some errors when users try to place an order, but you don't have the time or expertise to fix them.
You also need a full time customer support person to handle all the questions and complaints that are coming in, as well as an operations person to help you manage the inventory and shipping.

You decide to raise some money to help you grow the business.

### Data Requirements

#### Automating KPIs

You no longer have the time to update your spreadsheet every weekend, so you decide to automate this process.

#### Basic Operations

You need to make sure you have the raw ingredients to make jaffles, so you set up a simple dashboard that keeps track of
your inventory levels so you can place an order if you're running low.

Your customer support person also needs a way to fetch the details of an order if a user has a question or complaint,
so you set up a simple interface that allows them to search for an order by order number.

### Data Investments

#### Simple Automations

At this stage you can still get by with a simple SQL database and a cron job that runs every night to update your spreadsheet.
The amount of data you're processing is quite small so you're still running queries against your production database.

## Series A

Jaffle shop is now a well-known brand and you have a loyal customer base that keeps coming back for more jaffles.

You set up a data warehouse to centralize your data from various sources, such as your SQL databases, Google Analytics, and CRM system.

ensuring that it is cleaned and transformed for analysis.

past purchases and browsing behavior.

purchase history, and behavior.

interventions, such as special offers or personalized messages, to retain these customers.

### Data Investments

As your data volume and complexity grow, you need a robust ETL system to efficiently handle diverse data sources

You also need to build comprehensive data models that reflect your businessprocesses, supporting more

strategies to retain and grow these relationships.

### Data Investments
